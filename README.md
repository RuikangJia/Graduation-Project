# Welcome!
In this project, I saved the program I wrote when I completed my graduate studies. These programs are written in R and are mainly used for RNA-seq data analysis.

- Data download and organization
- Analysis of gene expression differences
- WGCNA analysis
- Functional enrichment analysis
- Core gene identification
- Support vector machine analysis
- Survive analysis
